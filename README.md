# TravelNiche-App
An application that allows users to randomly populate a daily planner based on their personal preferences and travel location.

Will require a visit to 'cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com' to allow browser access to the Yelp Fusion API - workaround hopefully to come. The link will pop-up in the console.

## Deployed Website

[TravelNiche - Bar Locator](https://travelniche.github.io/TravelNiche-App/)

## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking is always fun when you find the right people and nice atmosphere. We can't help you make friends but we can find you a bar that you may like with just one click! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the right spot for drinking is not easy to find and may take time. We designed a bar locator app to help you find your favorite bar anywhere in the world. By designing this app, we practiced our skill using server-side APIs, CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap, etc.

## Usage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply type in a location where you want to find your favorite bar located at! The bars are displayed with the help of Geoapify API and Yelp Fusion API. The results are shown with random price range, but you can always set yourself a price range using checkboxes. Also, see the list of recent location searches right next to it and click to navigate faster between results. The TravelNiche works for every location in the world as well!
